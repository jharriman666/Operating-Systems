Microsoft Windows is a proprietary operating system that was introduced by Microsoft in 1985.
Windows dominated the Personal Computer market, overtaking Apple's macOS which had been released a year prior.
To this day, Windows remains the most widely used operating system on PCs, but they pale in comparison to competition when it comes to mobile Operating Systems.
